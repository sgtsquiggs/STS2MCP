## GET — State Types

Every JSON response includes:
- `state_type` — which screen the game is on (see below)
- `run` — `{ act, floor, ascension }` (absent for `menu`)
- `player` — full player state: character, HP, gold, relics, potions, `max_potion_slots` (belt capacity, grows with relics), `deck` / `deck_size` (full deck: id, name, type, rarity, cost, is_upgraded, enchantment, affliction), and during combat: energy, hand, `hand_size` / `max_hand_size` / `hand_full`, piles, orbs (absent for `menu`)
- `battle` (combat) — also has readiness fields: `ready_for_input` (safe to play/end turn now: hand dealt, no actions queued or running), `is_action_queue_empty`, `is_action_running`, `player_actions_disabled`, `player_phase`
- `map` nodes (`nodes`, `next_options`, `leads_to`) have `markers` (e.g. Fur Coat: `effect: "enemies_one_hp"`, also `enemies_one_hp: true` on the node; Spoils Map: `buried_treasure`)

| `state_type` | Screen | Available Actions |

## POST — Actions

All POST requests use JSON body with `"action"` field. All responses include `{ "status": "ok" | "error", "message": "..." }`.

### Menu / Game Over

| Action | Parameters | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| `menu_select` | `option`: string, `seed`?: string | Choose an advertised menu option. Options are case-insensitive. Submenus include `back` where visible, including `profile_select` options `profile_1`, `profile_2`, `profile_3`, and `back`. Blocking popups expose normalized button labels such as `ignore` or `back`. `game_over` supports `main_menu` only; `continue` returns an error. Supplying `seed` in unsupported contexts such as standard singleplayer character select returns an error and does not start a run. If Timeline has pending obtained epochs that require manual reveal, it may appear in `blocked_options`; selecting `timeline` returns `manual_action_required: true` with `pending_epoch_ids` instead of opening Timeline. Multiplayer flow: on `multiplayer_join` use `refresh` / `back` / `join_<index>` / `join_<player_id>`. On `multiplayer_load_lobby` use `confirm` (or `embark`) to ready up, `unready` to retract, `back` to leave. On `character_select` while in MP, an additional `unready` option becomes available after readying, plus a `lobby` block in state lists ascension, all_ready, and per-player roster. |

### Profiles

`GET /api/v1/profile` returns persistent progress for the active profile, including character stats, discoveries, achievements, epochs, and global run totals.

`GET /api/v1/compendium` returns the active profile grouped like the in-game Compendium:

When a run is active, the response includes `current_run.run_id` in `{save_scope}:profile{profile_id}:{start_time}` format. This identifies the specific run attempt, while `seed` identifies the generated run content.

| Section | Status |
|---|---|
| `card_library` | Discovered cards plus pick/skip/win/loss stats. Card rules text is supplied by game state when cards are visible in a run. |
| `relic_collection` | Discovered relic IDs. Profile data does not expose a typed per-relic description or obtained-count catalog. |
| `potion_lab` | Discovered potion IDs. Profile data does not expose a typed per-potion rules text or lab metadata catalog. |
| `bestiary` | Encounter/enemy profile fight stats. The game UI marks Bestiary as future/locked, so this is stats-only rather than a full enemy catalog. |
| `character_stats` | Per-character and global totals. |
| `run_history` | Summaries of the active profile's saved `saves/history/*.run` files, capped to the 20 most recent entries. |

Run history is resolved from the active Steam account's profile save root. `current_run.run_id` identifies one concrete attempt; `seed` identifies generated run content and can repeat across attempts.

`GET /api/v1/wiki?query=<text>&item_type=<all|card|relic>&limit=<n>` returns a bounded fuzzy-search result over the active profile's discovered cards and relics. `query` is required because this endpoint is intentionally selective and does not dump the full catalog. `item_type` defaults to `all`, and `limit` defaults to 10 with an internal maximum. Card results include both `base` and `upgraded` objects when the card can be upgraded.

Example searches:

- `/api/v1/wiki?query=ironclad%20perfect%20strike&item_type=card`
- `/api/v1/wiki?query=silver%20spoon&item_type=relic&limit=5`

`GET /api/v1/profiles` returns the three profile slots:

```json
{
  "current_profile_id": 1,
  "profiles": [
    { "id": 1, "is_current": true, "has_data": true },
    { "id": 2, "is_current": false, "has_data": false },
    { "id": 3, "is_current": false, "has_data": true }
  ]
}
```
