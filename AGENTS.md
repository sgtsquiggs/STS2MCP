# STS2 MCP — AI Gameplay Guide

## Fast CLI driver (preferred over individual MCP calls)
`python .claude/scripts/sts.py` talks to the mod's HTTP API directly. It plays cards by name, re-resolves the hand index before each play, waits through enemy turns, and auto-loots after combat (gold, relics, potions if there's room, then opens the card reward).
- `sts.py` summary · `sts.py map` ASCII map · `sts.py turn Bodyguard Blight@1 Defend end` · `sts.py pot 0 [target]`
- `sts.py do choose_map_node index=1` (or any raw action, e.g. choose_event_option, select_card_reward card_index=, choose_rest_option, proceed, select_card, confirm_selection)

## Improvement policy (tooling: sts.py autopilot, rlsim advisor)
- **Continuous:** notice a problem → log it with evidence (greedy: the page changelog; rlsim: `rlsim_notes.md`) → ship when the logged evidence gives ≥70% confidence it's a net win.
- **Mid-run:** ship only fixes that will matter for the rest of the current run. Defer the rest.
- **Between runs:** make the bigger changes (simulator data refresh, scoring rework, new features).
- **Parallelism:** delegate code work to background subagents while play continues. Live-used files (sts.py, advisor_rlsim.py) are edited in a copy and swapped in atomically.
- **Commit as we go:** the toolkit repo is `~/Projects/sts2-autoplay` (private GitHub repo; CI runs ruff + unit tests). `.claude/scripts` is a symlink to it.

## MCP Tool Calling Tips

### State Polling
- After `combat_end_turn`, the state may show `is_play_phase: false` or `turn: enemy`. Call `get_game_state` again to advance to the next player turn.
- Sometimes you need to call `get_game_state` twice — once to see enemy turn results, once to see your new hand.
- Use `format: "json"` during combat for structured data; `format: "markdown"` for map/event overview.

### Card Index Shifting
- **CRITICAL**: Playing a card removes it from hand and shifts all indices. Play cards from RIGHT to LEFT (highest index first) to keep lower indices stable, or re-check state between plays.
- When targeting, always provide `target` for single-target cards. Entity IDs are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE with a `_0` suffix (e.g. `KIN_PRIEST_0`).

### Event & Reward Flow
- Events: `event_choose_option`. After choosing, there's often a "Proceed" option at index 0.
- Rest sites: `rest_choose_option`, then `proceed_to_map`.
- Rewards: claim from right-to-left (highest index first) to avoid index shifting. Card rewards open a sub-screen; use `rewards_pick_card` or `rewards_skip_card`.

### Potions
- `use_potion(slot=N)` — slot is the potion slot index, not a card index.
- `discard_potion(slot=N)` — discard a potion to free up the slot when full.
- Potions don't cost energy or count as card plays. Use buff potions BEFORE playing cards.

## General Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **HP is a resource, not a score.** Take calculated damage to deal more. Don't waste energy on block when enemies aren't attacking.
2. **Deck quality > deck size.** Skip card rewards if nothing synergizes. A lean deck draws key cards more often.
3. **Front-load damage.** Killing enemies faster means less total damage taken.
4. **Read intents carefully.** Sleep/Buff = go all-out offense. Attack = balance block and damage. Debuff = usually no damage, offense turn.

### Combat Sequencing (General)
1. Play 0-cost utility/setup cards first.
2. Play skills before attacks when possible — many mechanics reward this order (e.g. Slow debuff on enemies stacks per card played).
3. Play biggest attacks last to benefit from accumulated buffs/debuffs.
4. Check enemy HP — if you can kill this turn, skip blocking entirely.

### Map Pathing
- **Check the act boss first.** The `sts.py` map summary shows `BOSS:` (from the map state's `boss`/`bosses`). Look it up in GUIDE.md and the wiki (`search_wiki`), then draft and path toward what that fight needs.
- **Elites** give relics — fight them when healthy (>70% HP).
- **Rest before Boss** — heal if below 80% HP. Boss fights are long and punishing.
- **Unknown nodes** are safer than Elites. Good at medium HP.
- **Shops** — visit with 100+ gold.
- **Deck quality matters more than quantity** — don't add cards just because they're offered.

### Boss Fights
- **Kill the leader, not the minions.** Enemies with "Minion" power flee when their leader dies.
- Use potions aggressively in boss fights — they don't carry between acts.
- Boss fights are wars of attrition. The longer they go, the more enemies scale with Strength buffs.

### Potion Usage
- Don't hoard potions. Dying with full potions is the worst outcome.
- Use permanent-value potions (Fruit Juice = +5 Max HP) early in any combat.
- Use buff potions (Flex Potion) on turns with multiple attacks.

### Common Mistakes
- Blocking when enemies are sleeping/buffing — waste of energy.
- Not checking card indices after playing — indices shift left.
- Taking too long to kill bosses — enemies scale every turn.
- Adding mediocre cards that dilute the deck before boss fights.
