### Profile Tools

`get_profile()` returns the raw active-profile progress summary: character totals, global totals, discoveries, achievements, epochs, and aggregate stats.

`get_compendium()` presents the same profile data in the shape agents usually need when reasoning about long-term progress. It groups the response into `card_library`, `relic_collection`, `potion_lab`, `bestiary`, `character_stats`, and `run_history`, matching the high-level Compendium cards in the game UI. It also includes `current_run` while a run is active, with a derived `run_id` in `{save_scope}:profile{profile_id}:{start_time}` format.

The Compendium response is profile-scoped, not run-state-scoped. It works from the main menu, does not require navigating the in-game Compendium UI, and summarizes only the 20 most recent saved run-history files to keep the MCP response bounded.

`search_wiki(query, item_type="all", limit=10)` is the selective wiki lookup. It fuzzy-matches names and IDs such as `ironclad perfect strike` or `silver spoon`, but it searches only cards and relics discovered by the active profile. The default response is capped at 10 entries; callers may pass a higher or lower `limit`, and the mod clamps oversized requests. Card matches include `base` and `upgraded` blocks so agents can compare pre-upgrade and post-upgrade text without asking for the full card library.
